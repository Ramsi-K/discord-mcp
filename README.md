## Understanding MCP Architecture

MCP (Model-Context Protocol) is Anthropic's standardized protocol for connecting AI models with external tools and data sources. Think of it as a bridge between your Discord bot and Claude (or other models), where:

- MCP Client: Your Discord bot (connects to Discord API)
- MCP Server: Your backend service (manages tools, context, memory)
- Model: Claude API (processes requests with tools/context)

The flow is: Discord Message → Your Bot → MCP Server → Claude API (with tools) → Response back through chain.
Core Components You'll Need

## Discord Bot (client-side MCP)

- MCP Server (FastAPI backend)
- Database (user sessions, memory, context)
- Tool Registry (Discord-specific tools)
- Context Manager (conversation memory)
- Model Interface (Claude API integration)

## Step-by-Step Development Plan

### Phase 1: Local MCP Server Foundation

Start with a simple FastAPI server that implements MCP protocol locally.

### Phase 2: Discord Bot Integration

Connect your Discord bot to the MCP server.

### Phase 3: Tool System

Add Discord-specific tools (user lookup, channel management, etc.).

### Phase 4: Memory & Context

Implement persistent conversation memory.

### Phase 5: Production & Scaling

Deploy with proper hosting, monitoring, and scaling.

## Technology Stack Recommendations

### Backend Framework: FastAPI over Flask

- Better async support (crucial for Discord)
- Automatic API documentation
- Built-in validation with Pydantic
- WebSocket support for real-time features

### Database: PostgreSQL over SQLite

- Better concurrency for multiple Discord servers
- JSON columns for flexible context storage
- Proper indexing for conversation history

### Model Integration: Direct Anthropic API over LangChain

- More control over MCP implementation
- Better error handling
- Cleaner abstraction for your use case

### Hosting: Railway or Fly.io over traditional VPS

- Easy deployment
- Built-in scaling
- Good free tiers for development
