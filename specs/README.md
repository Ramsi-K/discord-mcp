# Discord MCP Server Specification

This repository contains the complete specification for a Discord MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation.

## Overview

The Discord MCP server provides AI-assisted Discord server management capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It allows AI assistants like Claude to interact with Discord servers through a set of well-defined tools, resources, and prompts.

## Key Components

### 1. Member Management

Tools for tracking, analyzing, and managing server members, including:

- Member export and filtering
- Interest analysis and tracking
- New member monitoring
- Member database synchronization

### 2. Channel Management

Tools for working with channels, messages, and threads, including:

- Channel statistics and analytics
- Message retrieval and sending
- Thread creation and management
- Reaction analysis

### 3. Role Management

Tools for creating, assigning, and managing roles, including:

- Role creation with customization
- Individual and bulk role assignment
- Role filtering and management
- Permission handling

### 4. Infrastructure and Admin

Tools for system administration and monitoring, including:

- Server statistics and health checks
- Tool usage logging and monitoring
- Tool enabling/disabling
- Debugging and testing

### 5. Prompts

AI-powered prompts for generating content and analysis, including:

- Channel summarization
- Member interest analysis
- Welcome message generation
- Announcement formatting

## Implementation Approach

The Discord MCP server is designed to be:

1. **Bot-Based**: Uses a Discord bot for API access
2. **Permission-Aware**: Respects Discord's permission system
3. **Database-Backed**: Stores member data for persistent analysis
4. **Modular**: Organized by functional categories
5. **Secure**: Implements proper authentication and rate limiting

## Getting Started

To implement this specification:

1. Review the requirements document
2. Study the design document for architecture details
3. Follow the implementation tasks in order
4. Refer to tool specifications for detailed API requirements

## Security Considerations

- All tools respect Discord's permission system
- Sensitive operations require appropriate permissions
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Comprehensive logging tracks all tool usage
