## Implementation Notes

These future tools will require:

1. **Vector Database Integration**:

   - Local vector database (Qdrant or Chroma)
   - Embedding generation capabilities
   - Efficient similarity search

2. **Advanced Scheduling**:

   - Job scheduling system
   - Persistent storage for scheduled tasks
   - Reliable execution guarantees

3. **Analytics Engine**:
   - Data aggregation and processing
   - Statistical analysis capabilities
   - Visualization components

All future tools will maintain the local-first approach, with optional cloud components for specific features that require it.
